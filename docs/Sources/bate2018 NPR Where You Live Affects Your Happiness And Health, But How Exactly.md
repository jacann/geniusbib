- "A Yale-led team of researchers has identified 12 community factors independently related to well-being. The factors included some obvious ones, such as higher levels of education and income, as well as some surprises, including a higher percentage of black residents, a higher percentage of bicycle commuters, and better access to preventive care, such as mammograms."

- Of 75 identified community attributes, only 12 related to "demographics, clinical care, or social and economics characteristics"
- **90% of the variation in well-being across the country is explained by the physical environment**
- Communities with higher percentages of black residents reported higher levels of well-being
- "People living in places where they could commute to work by bike reported feelings of satisfaction and fulfillment."
	- Potential reasons include
		- bike-friendly place might support other policies to improve living conditions
		- biking improves physical health, and thus wellbeing
### Limitations
- Cross-sectional, did not use data over time; it's a "snapshot in time"
### Suggestions
- Further research on wellbeing & what can influence it: "researchers need to gather information on larger scale community and civic well-being to bring everything together."

> The Color of Law demonstrates that racially explicit government policies to segregate our metropolitan areas are not vestiges, were neither subtle nor intangible, and were sufficiently controlling to construct the de jure segregation that is now with us in neighborhoods and hence in schools. The core argument of this book is that African Americans were unconstitutionally denied the means and the right to integration in middle-class neighborhoods, and because this denial was state-sponsored, the nation is obligated to remedy it.

> We have created a caste system in this country, with African Americans kept exploited and geographically separate by racially explicit government policies... they have never been remedied and their effects endure.

# Notes
## Preface
- Differences between [[de facto segregation]] and [[de jure segregation]]
- Racial segregation is the result of "unhidden public policy that explicitly segregated every metropolitan area in the United States," and it was so systematic and forereef l that its affects endure to the present (VIII)
- residential racial segregation by state action is a violation of the [[US Constitution]] and its [[Bill of Rights]]
	- The [[Fifth Amendment]] prohibits the federal gov. form treating citizens unfairly
	- The [[Thirteenth Amendment]] prohibits slavery or treating African Americans as second-class citizens
	- The [[Fourteenth Amendment]] prohibits states and local governments from treating people unfairly or unequally
- "housing discrimination did not become unlawful in 1968; it had been so since 1866" ([[1866 Civil Rights Act]])
- the "[[de facto segregation]] myth has... been adopted by conventional opinion, liberal and conservative alike" (XII)
	- popularized by supreme court majorities
### Notes on language use
- *We* means all of us, the American community
	- "African Americans cannot await rectification of past wrongs as a gift, and white Americans collectively do not owe it to African Americans to rectify them. We, all of us, owe this to ourselves. As American citizens, whatever routes we or our particular ancestors took to get to this point, we’re all in this together now."
- The term *ghetto* will be explicitly used, as it is the correct word for describing the phenomena
- *Diversity* will not be used, it avoids confronting a history of racial exclusion
- *People of color* will be avoided, as this text discusses practices that singled out African Americans.


## If San Francisco, Then Everywhere?
> This chapter investigates segragation in the San Francisco area during and in the years after WWII
### 1. Richmond, WWII, and Housing Policy (Frank Stevenson)
- Franklin Roosevelt's [[New Deal]] prohibited child labor and established minimum wages, however African Americans were excluded due to pressure from southern congressmen and senators (4)
- [[Richmond]] (home to a major WWII industrial area)
	- Dramatic (pop 24k to 100k from 1940-45) influx of workers during war, housing was needed
		- Federal gov. provided public housing that was offically and  explicitly segregated
			- Housing for AA was poorly constructed, intended to be temporary
			- Some white areas received better housing
	- Recreation Dept. and other social orgs. pressured into maintaining segregated spaces
	- Gov. created programs such as the [[war guest program]] to help white workers, and created a new suburb for white housing, [[Rollingwood]]
		- Fed. govt. approved bank loans to finance construction, and required that no housing could be sold to AAs
		- Resulted in white families moving out of poor public housing, and AAs becoming stuck in war housing
	- Gov. collaborated with private groups to segregate Richmond
	- United Services Organization (USO)
		- maintained segregated clubs, Travelers' Aid, etc. 
			- city council prevented plan to place an AA service center on property in a white neighborhood
			- tight roots to Roosevelt, Roosevelt could pressure
- Ford moving Richmond plant to Milpitas
	- Upon notice, Milpitas residents banned apartment construction and allowed only single-family homes
		- [[Federal Housing Administration]] (FHA) then approved their plans, and got low-interest loans from banks with the approvals
			- FHA's insured mortgages barred sales to African Americans
### 2. Stanford Area, Post-WWII (Wallace Stegner)
- At the end of WWII, Stanford area had a housing shortage
- A new arrival, Stegner and peers attempted to form a housing co-op
	- of 150 first families to join, 3 were African American
	- banks would not finance construction of the co-op without FHA approval, and the FHA would not insure the due to those three African American families
	- Co-op eventually failed, land sold
		- Final development was bound by the FHA to only house whites
### 3. Palo Alto, Blockbusting, Real Estate, and more FHA policy
#### Background
- No fed-loan-funded developer could sell to African Americans
- No Cali. state-licensed real estate agent would show African Americans houses
#### 1954: One black family moves into a white neighborhood (East Palo Alto)
##### Blockbusting
- California Real Estate Association moved in
- They warn of a "Negro invasion"
- Whites panic-sold houses at discounted prices
- These homes were sold to African Americans, sold at inflated prices
- **This is [[blockbusting]] in action**
##### FHA
- refused to insure mortgages for whites in a neighborhood where African Americans were present
- banks and insurance companies held similar policies (with consent of fed. banking regulators)
##### The creation of a slum
- 6 years after, East Palo Alto was 82% black
- Population density increased
	- Limited housing for African Americans in general
	- Higher prices meant owners had difficulty making payments w/o add. rental income
- **"Federal and state housing policy had created a slum in East Palo Alto"**
##### And now the schools
- More people meant a new school was needed
- the school board constructed a new school, drawing attendance lines to segregate both schools
### Endnotes
- In San Francisco, the Federal Government imposed segregation where it hadn't previously taken root.

### Examples of *de facto* segregation
- Often-cited examples of de facto segregation of black people in the US include (from Rothstein VII): 
	- "[[white flight]]"
		- "When African Americans moved into a neighborhood like Ferguson, a few racially prejudiced white families decided to leave, and then as the number of black families grew, the neighborhood deteriorated, and “white flight” followed."
	- Real estate practices
		- "Real estate agents steered whites away from black neighborhoods, and blacks away from white ones."
	- [[redlining|Redlining]]
		- "Banks discriminated with “redlining,” refusing to give mortgages to African Americans or extracting unusually severe terms from them with subprime loans."
	- Disparities in education/income
		- "African Americans haven’t generally gotten the educations that would enable them to earn sufficient incomes to live in white suburbs, and, as a result, many remain concentrated in urban neighborhoods."
	- Self-composition by residents
		- "Besides, black families prefer to live with one another."
